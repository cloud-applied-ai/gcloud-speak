# ‚òÅÔ∏è gcloud-speak

Talk to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment directly from your command line! [gcloud-speak] leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand your natural language commands and translate them into executable `gcloud` commands, making cloud management more intuitive and efficient.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Natural Language Interface:** Speak to your cloud using plain English. No need to memorize complex `gcloud` syntax.
* **LLM Reasoning:** Powered by Google's Gemini family of models (via the Google AI SDK), the tool intelligently interprets your requests.
* **Local Execution:** Executes `gcloud` commands directly on your local system, respecting your current `gcloud` configuration and authentication.
* **Streamlined Cloud Management:** Simplify common and complex GCP operations through conversational interaction.

## ‚ú® How it Works

gcloud-speak acts as an intelligent intermediary. When you type a command in natural language:

1.  It sends your input to a Gemini model.
2.  The Gemini model, through its reasoning capabilities, determines the appropriate `gcloud` command to fulfill your request.
3.  The adk tool executes the corresponding `gcloud` command depending on your implementation preference ‚Äì *consider adding a confirmation step for safety!*.
4.  The `gcloud` command is executed in your shell, just as if you typed it yourself.

**Important:** This tool relies on your local `gcloud` CLI being properly installed, configured, and authenticated with your GCP project.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you can use [Your Tool Name Here], ensure you have the following:

1.  **Python 3.8+:** The tool is built with Python.
2.  **Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud` CLI):**
    * Install the `gcloud` CLI if you haven't already: [https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
    * Ensure you are authenticated (`gcloud auth login`) and have set your default project (`gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID`).
3.  **Google ADK SDK (or necessary libraries):** These will be installed via `pip` as part of the setup.
4.  **A Google Cloud Project:** With billing enabled, if you plan to use features that incur costs.
5.  **A Google API Key:** For accessing the Gemini model.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Follow these steps to get [Your Tool Name Here] up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/cloud-applied-ai/gcloud-speak.git](https://github.com/cloud-applied-ai/gcloud-speak.git)
    cd gloudtalkAgent # Or the name of your project directory
    ```


3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Make sure you have a requirements.txt file with your dependencies, e.g., google-generativeai, python-dotenv
    ```
    *If you don't have a `requirements.txt` yet, you'll need to install the `google-adk` library:*
    ```bash
    pip install google-adk
    ```

4.  **Create your `.env` file:**
    At the root level of your project directory (the same directory as this `README.md`), create a file named `.env` and add the following variables:

    ```ini
    GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    * **`GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE`**: This setting directs the Google AI SDK to use the public `generativeai` API rather than Vertex AI endpoints.
    * **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`**: Replace `"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual Google API Key. You can obtain one from the Google Cloud Console or Google AI Studio. Make sure it has access to the Gemini API.

## üöÄ Usage

Once set up, you can start interacting with [Your Tool Name Here]:

```bash
adk web 
```

VOILA start talking to through the app and it will do all the things over gcp using gcloud  by speaking to it as long as you have the right permissions.
